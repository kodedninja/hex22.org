text: 1. **Everything should be a tool.** A tool transforms data without adding to its source limitations. It's a function: returns an output for a given input.
2. **A great tool is [ambient](https://are.na/alex-singh/ambient-product-design).** It should disappear and flow through your actions. You should never need it because it's always at your hands. You should never ignore it because it's never in your way.
3. **Tools should be adaptable, changeable and personalisable**. If a tool does not perfectly fit your needs, you should be able to change, mix or remove its parts.
4. **Data should be reusable, text-editable, human-readable.** Produces a higher chance that (1.) is passed.
5. **Tools should be lightweight, available and timeless.** Computing power or internet speed shouldn't be the limitation for most tasks. It works in the past and in the future.
