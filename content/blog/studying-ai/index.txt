excerpt: Why did I choose artificial intelligence as my bachelor's program?
----
text: Today at 8:30 I had my first lecture at the [Johannes Kepler University](https://jku.at/) in Linz. I've moved here 14 months ago with the plans to start studying right away, but then I've decided to skip a year and start working. On the side, I also wanted to wait for a newly starting AI bachelor's program that was in the planning phase.

For the last 8 years of my life, since the age of 12, I knew that I want to pursue a career in some computer related field, which then seemed to be computer science. This have changed during the last years of high-school and I've become quite sure that I would not enjoy studying _raw_ computer science. I've decided to find a field that's as close to computers and programming as it can be, but it's still combined with some other field or science. 

Bioinformatics seemed like a good choice at first (last year), but after I've listened to the opinion of some people around me, I've realized that learning that much biology would be a compromise next to my interests in computers and the bare beauty of code.

Artifical intelligence is a _very hot topic_. No doubts about that. The interest in the program here at the JKU also supports this. I'm afraid many people came without knowing that artificial intelligence is not just beautiful high-level Python code and some large datasets. Yeah, we'll have quite some math.

I'm interested in data science and in working with big data because of two simple reasons. First I enjoy the process and working with them, like data visualization, like feeling how much useful information can be in almost any large dataset, which at first seems useless. Secondly, I don't trust the people who currently lead and control these fields. I don't trust Silicon Valley companies gaining ownership over all the data in the world.

I want to become an artificial intelligence scientist / developer because at the end of the day I want to know: _I did everything I could to turn this technology on the people's and not on the profit's side._

Hereby I encourage everyone who's afraid of AI and of a future _powered by AI_ to go and study. To become better than everyone else, better than those profit gobbling developers selling themselves for entities that are simply not trustworthy on the path to a better future. I see many people avoiding AI, putting it as a bad thing for the _mindful developer_, but with this attitude we only let this powerful technology fall out of the hands of people, into the pockets of companies.
