excerpt: My first try at building a peer-to-peer application based on [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) ― a retrospection.

_This entry was written one year after the events, as it's a very important period and I missed it from my timeline._

text: One night I've found many #rotonde tweets with beautiful 64 characters long URL-ish texts in my feed. A few minutes later I've found out that it's a little, "underground" social-network. It was peer-to-peer, something I've been interested in for a while, so I've downloaded [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) in an instant and made my profile. It was a slightly abstract way of joining a social-network, love at first sight.

And then there were features to build, bugs to fix ― so I've cloned the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/rotonde) and started contributing. They weren't important, core features, just little "fine-tunes", but they made me feel happy and curious.

_It was the time just before the rise of the peer-to-peer web, there were only a few applications and personal sites started to appear on the **dat://** protocol._

Somehow I've hacked together a little site, using the `DatArchive` API that lets you share files easily and beautifully. Honestly, its design was the reason why I've made it. Basically it's just an interface that renders the content of a directory and an event callback for `ondrop` that "uploads" the file to the archive. The whole thing made with jQuery.

But (and this is a very important "but"), it felt like some yet hidden power on the internet. I was there in my room, launching a modern file-sharing application without the need of a server and buying a domain name. Instantly, the feeling of "we're building a new internet, just like in the '90s" rushed through me.

I've shared it on Twitter and people actually liked and used it.

_If ntain were a baby, then everything I've made since then for the peer-to-peer web would be its periods of growing up. It had a determinate role to my current life._
