text: These points are my long-term opinions about product design and user experience. Product in the broadest sense of the word. Everything around us, material and nonmaterial objects, are products. Any interaction with them is user experience. 

1. **Everything should be a tool.** A tool transforms its input without adding to its limitations. It's a function: returns an output for a given input. Its invisibility maximizes user experience.
2. **Tools should be [ambient](https://are.na/alex-singh/ambient-product-design).** It disappears and flows through your actions. You should never need it because it's always at your hands. You should never ignore it because it's never in your way.
3. **Tools should be adaptable, changeable and personalisable**. If it does not perfectly fit your needs, you should be able to change, mix or remove its parts. You should be the one defining the limits of your interactions and not the tool.
4. **Tools should function transparently.** The material and the data they work on should be visible and understandable by humans.
5. **Tools should be surrounded by time.** It works in the past and in the future, but it is only relevant in the present. It may become redundant, but not unusable.
