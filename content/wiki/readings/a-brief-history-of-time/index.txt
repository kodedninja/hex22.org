There isn't much that I could add to this classic, but I want to leave a praising note here. It's a great book and, in my point of view, its place on the bookshelf of history is rock-solid.

Hawking wasn't just a grandiose mind, he was also able to wrap his thoughts into a simple and many times funny language, without losing the scientific validity of the presented topics somewhere on the way to readibility. He leads the reader through a journey of physics, before the arrival to the real topic: time, black-holes, the very beginning of our universe.

It was also surprising how he emphasizes the importance of the works of other physicists, which, based on my experiences, isn't always the case in similar books.

**I definitely recommend it** to anyone, who's interested in the universe, in life and in nature.
