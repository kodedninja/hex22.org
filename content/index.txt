right: Before I was experimenting with [peer-to-peer tools](/p2p/) (2017―2019) and co-launched a small tool called [Pictogon](https://pictogon.com) (2017).

bottom: I'm enjoying a break from social media, feeds and news, but you can follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/kodedninja), [Are.na](https://www.are.na/hunor-karaman) and through my [twtxt feed](https://t.seed.hex22.org/twtxt.txt). Feel free to reach out beyond this website to talk, to collaborate.
