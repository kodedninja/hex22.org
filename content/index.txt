excerpt: Cybernetic Self-Portrait

text: Why must we turn our gaze inward, embracing introspection, to establish a renewed connection with the landscape? With my work, this is the ambiguity I desire to unfold within a postnatural framework. Rejecting the term _nature_, and therefore decentering the _human_. Zooming in instead to where the two terms blur: the environment, the landfill. Language is compost is humus. A material shared between past and future.

Two times a year I publish a postnatural literary PDF pamphlet, **ERDŐ**. Other writings appear in Hungarian literary magazines.
