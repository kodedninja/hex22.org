text: My thoughts circulate around the internet, humans and their ambient interactions. I'm interested in small, fast websites. This is my personal space ― a sandbox, an archive.

I _currently_ study artificial intelligence at the [Johannes Kepler Universität](https://jku.at) (2019―), while being part of the website team at [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org) (2018―).

_Before_ I was experimenting with [peer-to-peer tools](/p2p/) (2017―2019) and co-launched a small tool called [Pictogon](https://pictogon.com) (2017).

I'm on a break from social media, feeds and news, but you can follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/kodedninja), [Are.na](https://www.are.na/hunor-karaman) and my [twtxt feed](https://t.seed.hex22.org/twtxt.txt). I'm happy to [discuss](malto:karamanhunor@pm.me) with you.
